# repo
Repo is used for creating github repositories from other template repositories.

## usage
node repo template-repository new-repository

This will clone template-repository from your user name and create a new repository called new-repository and set it up in your local directory.

## repo.bat
You can add repo.bat to your windows path so it can be used from anywhere! :D
